🚀 Access DeepSeek on Krutrim Without Writing Code

Krutrim has announced amazing starter plans to access DeepSeek, making cutting-edge AI models more accessible than ever. However, API calls can feel daunting for non-technical users.

To solve this, ChatWithDeepSeek provides a simple frontend that allows anyone to chat with DeepSeek models—no coding required!

🎯 How to Get Started

1️⃣ Sign Up on Krutrim Cloud

Register an account at Krutrim Cloud.

2️⃣ Create an API Key

Sign in → Go to Models > API Keys.

Click Create Secret Key and copy it.

Store the key safely (e.g., in a text file). You will need this to access DeepSeek.

3️⃣ Fund Your Account

Go to Billing > Add Credit.

Add a small amount (even ₹10 works to get started).

4️⃣ Start Chatting!

Visit 👉 ChatWithDeepSeek

Paste your API key into the app.

⚙️ How It Works

The frontend is built with React and hosted on GitHub Pages.

The proxy server is hosted on Render, allowing secure API requests to DeepSeek.

Your API key is never stored on our servers—it remains in your browser during your session and is only transmitted securely to the DeepSeek service on Krutrim when making requests via HTTPS encryption.
